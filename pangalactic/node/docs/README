Generating the html versions depends on the "pandoc" utility.

    ./htmlify user_guide.md
    ./htmlify reference.md
    ./htmlify cattens_user_guide.md
    ./htmlify cattens_reference.md

(Note that htmlify uses the pandoc.css stylesheet.)

NOTE:  when creating figures using the "dia" diagramming tool, if there are
aliasing and/or resolution problems, the best anti-aliasing and resolution can
be obtained by this procedure:

    * export to .svg format
    * import the .svg file into Inkscape
    * export to .png from Inkscape

Exporting directly from dia to .png gives very poor anti-aliasing and no
control over scaling the output.
