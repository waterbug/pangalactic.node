Generating the help docs depends on the "pandoc" utility.

    ./htmlify user_guide.md

... creates user_guide.html, using the pandoc.css stylesheet.

NOTE:  when creating figures using the "dia" diagramming tool, the best
anti-aliasing and resolution can be obtained by this procedure:

    * export to .svg format
    * import the .svg file into Inkscape
    * export to .png from Inkscape

Exporting directly from dia to .png gives very poor anti-aliasing and no
control over scaling the output.
